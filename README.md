## About:

This repository is an implementation of OpenFlow on the NetFPGA for my senior project in Computer Engineering at CSU Chico.

A little bit about OpenFlow from their site:
> OpenFlow enables networks to evolve, by giving a remote controller the power to modify the behavior of network devices, through a well-defined "forwarding instruction set". The growing OpenFlow ecosystem now includes routers, switches, virtual switches, and access points from a range of vendors.

I chose this project because I wanted to know more about OpenFlow and because I've developed a vast interest in network technologies since I started at Chico.  I will be designing my project according to the [OpenFlow Switch Specification 1.0.0](http://www.openflow.org/documents/openflow-spec-v1.0.0.pdf) (pdf).  The goal of the project is to design and implement a fully functional OpenFlow enabled switch that can be integrated with a controller.
