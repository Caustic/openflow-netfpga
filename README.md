## About:

This repository is an implementation of OpenFlow on the NetFPGA for my senior project in Computer Engineering at CSU Chico.

A little bit about OpenFlow from their site:
> OpenFlow enables networks to evolve, by giving a remote controller the power to modify the behavior of network devices, through a well-defined "forwarding instruction set". The growing OpenFlow ecosystem now includes routers, switches, virtual switches, and access points from a range of vendors.
